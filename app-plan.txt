USER STATE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:

1. User States:
   - No Mess State: User can create or join mess
   - Pending Request State: User waiting for admin approval
   - Mess Member State: User is active member
   - Mess Admin State: User is mess admin with privileges

2. State Flags (from /api/auth/me):
   - hasMess: User is member of a mess
   - isMessAdmin: User is mess admin
   - hasPendingRequest: User has pending join request
   - pendingRequestMess: Details of mess with pending request
   - canCreateMess: User can create new mess
   - canJoinMess: User can join existing mess
   - shouldShowDashboard: User should see main dashboard

3. Real-time Features:
   - Request status polling support
   - Automatic state updates
   - Cancel request functionality
   - Seamless UI transitions

SECURITY FEATURES:
- JWT authentication with unlimited expiry
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Email verification with OTP
- Role-based access control (mess admin)
- Data isolation (users only see their mess data)
- Input validation and sanitization
- State-based access control

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REQUIRED:
- MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/homeManagementFinal
- JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
- EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
- EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password
- PORT=3000

KEY BUSINESS LOGIC:

1. USER REGISTRATION FLOW:
   - User signs up → OTP sent to email
   - User verifies OTP → Account activated
   - User can login → Gets unlimited JWT token
   - Unverified users can re-register (old account deleted)

2. USER STATE MANAGEMENT FLOW:
   - User logs in → /api/auth/me called
   - System determines user state based on:
     * Current mess membership
     * Pending join requests
     * Admin status
   - Frontend routes to appropriate UI based on state flags
   - Real-time polling for pending request status updates

3. MESS CREATION FLOW:
   - User creates mess → Becomes admin
   - Gets unique 6-digit identifier code
   - Can invite others using the code
   - Admin has additional privileges
   - Users request to join → Admin approves/rejects

4. MESS JOINING FLOW:
   - User requests to join → Pending state
   - Frontend shows waiting screen with cancel option
   - Real-time polling checks for status updates
   - If accepted → User becomes member, redirected to dashboard
   - If rejected → User can try joining another mess
   - User can cancel request anytime

5. FINANCIAL CALCULATION:
   - Total bazar cost / Total meals = Meal rate
   - User cost = User meals × Meal rate
   - User balance = Deposits - User cost

6. DATA ISOLATION:
   - All operations scoped to user's current mess
   - Users can only access their mess data
   - Admin can manage mess members

FRONTEND INTEGRATION:

1. State-Based Routing:
   - Use /api/auth/me response to determine UI state
   - Implement state flags for conditional rendering
   - Handle all user states gracefully

2. Real-time Updates:
   - Poll /api/mess/check-request-status for pending requests
   - Implement proper cleanup for polling intervals
   - Handle status changes with smooth transitions

3. Error Handling:
   - Graceful API error handling
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Retry mechanisms for failed requests

4. Performance Optimization:
   - Cache user state appropriately
   - Use efficient polling intervals
   - Implement proper cleanup

MIGRATION FROM V1:
- Removed room-based system
- Added user authentication
- Introduced mess concept
- Updated all models for user-based system
- Added comprehensive access control
- Implemented user state management
- Added real-time request status checking

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
- Admin transfer functionality
- Mess statistics and analytics
- Export/import functionality
- Push notifications
- Mobile app integration
- Advanced reporting features
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Offline support with sync

DEPLOYMENT NOTES:
- Database: MongoDB (local or cloud)
- Email: Gmail SMTP with App Password
- Server: Node.js environment
- Documentation: Swagger UI at /api-docs
- State Management: Comprehensive user state system

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- Email issues: Check Gmail App Password setup
- Database issues: Verify MONGO_URI connection
- JWT issues: Ensure JWT_SECRET is set
- OTP issues: Check email configuration
- State issues: Verify user state flags
- Polling issues: Check cleanup in component destruction
